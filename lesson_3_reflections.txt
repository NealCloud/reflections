When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When working from multiple computers or with other people. Also just as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Incase you are working on code that has been modified on the remote repository you havn't looked at yet.
