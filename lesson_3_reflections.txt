When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When working from multiple computers or with other people. Also just as a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Incase you are working on code that has been modified on the remote repository you havn't looked at yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Clone copies a repository, while a fork does the same but from one Github account to another linking back to the original.
	Branch is for making a seperate path in a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	So you always have access to the latest code changes making it less likely to introduce merge conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Much more difficult unless you work in the same office I suppose.
